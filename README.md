### The Algorithm
I have used Caesar Cipher to encode and decode the given text. Encoding: each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
For Example: encrypt and run 

text = NURIZA

encryption code = 5

output --> szwnef

We use the given shift in the opposite direction to decrypt the original text.
